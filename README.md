# Raspberry Pi Forward Proxy Lab

This repo supports a two-part series on using a Raspberry Pi as:

1. **A manual proxy** (with `proxychains`, SSH tunnel, and Squid)
2. **A transparent network proxy** (with `redsocks` and `iptables`)

Follow the tutorials to build and deploy your own DIY proxy setup.
